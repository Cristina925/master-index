## Why This Exists
We’re seeing a quiet shift globally.

Regulators are no longer asking what systems are capable of —
they’re asking how actions were governed at the moment they occurred.

In practice, many failures don’t come from intent or design.
They come from systems proceeding while authority, responsibility, or context is unresolved.

This repository contains a small, neutral index of governance and evidence artefacts
designed for those moments — when records, legitimacy, and accountability suddenly matter.

This is not a product, not guidance, and not advice.
It is recognition-level material for decision owners operating under scrutiny.


### Status

All materials in this repository are provided at recognition level only.
They are non-normative and intentionally scoped.
