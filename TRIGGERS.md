# TRIGGERS — When This Index Becomes Necessary

This index is typically consulted when organisations must demonstrate
legitimacy, responsibility, and evidentiary sufficiency **at the time an action was taken**.

It becomes relevant when one or more of the following triggers occur.

---

## 1) Delegated, Automated, or AI-Mediated Action Is Questioned

**Trigger**
- A system takes consequential action and oversight/authority is challenged afterwards.

**Common prompts**
- “Who authorised this to proceed?”
- “Was authority valid at the point of execution?”
- “What governance existed at the moment of action?”

**Typically pull**
- Decision context / decision continuity records
- Authority validity / revalidation artefacts
- Incident-safe language (for internal and external statements)

---

## 2) A Regulator or Auditor Requests Evidence (Not Narrative)

**Trigger**
- An external or internal assurance function asks for proof: records, logs, accountable owners, and decision trace.

**Common prompts**
- “Show us the record.”
- “What evidence existed before execution?”
- “Who held responsibility at that point, and how is that captured?”

**Typically pull**
- Record-keeping readiness packs
- Conformance records / responsible individual verification
- Evidence mapping artefacts

---

## 3) An Incident, Harm Event, or Breach Occurs

**Trigger**
- A reportable or material event occurs and timelines/obligations activate immediately.

**Common prompts**
- “Is this reportable?”
- “What must be preserved right now?”
- “What wording is safe to use?”

**Typically pull**
- Incident & adverse event readiness artefacts
- Reporting timelines and preservation checklists
- Incident language pack

---

## 4) Online Safety / Platform Risk Duties Activate (UK / EU)

**Trigger**
- Risk assessment, transparency reporting, or enforcement exposure requires documented process.

**Common prompts**
- “Where is the risk assessment record?”
- “How were safeguards governed and reviewed?”
- “What documentation supports compliance?”

**Typically pull**
- Online safety record-keeping readiness material
- Governance language artefacts
- Evidence mapping documents

---

## 5) Sector-Specific Product Obligations Apply (e.g., Cosmetics)

**Trigger**
- Statutory compliance evidence and adverse event reporting obligations apply with fixed deadlines.

**Common prompts**
- “What evidence is required?”
- “What is the reporting clock?”
- “What must be included, and what must be avoided?”

**Typically pull**
- Sector compliance evidence packs
- Adverse event / incident reporting artefacts
- Incident language guidance

---

## Why These Triggers Matter

Many failures do not originate from malicious intent or technical inability.
They originate from systems proceeding while authority, responsibility, or context is unresolved.

This index is designed to be used **before**, **during**, or **immediately after** those moments.

## Regulatory scrutiny clocks (contextual)
Across multiple regulatory and supervisory domains, incident and decision scrutiny is increasingly time-bound.

In several regimes, organisations are expected to produce contemporaneous records within compressed timeframes following an incident or material action. These time-bound scrutiny patterns increase the importance of having documentation that reflects what was known, relied upon, and authorised at the moment of action, rather than reconstructed later.

This is observable in emerging incident reporting expectations, operational resilience oversight, and cross-border supervisory cooperation, where early notification, follow-up reporting, and final review stages are explicitly sequenced.
